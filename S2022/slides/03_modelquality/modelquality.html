</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## ML Algorithm Quality vs Model Quality vs Data Quality vs System Quality

Todays focus is on the quality of the produced *model*, not the algorithm used to learn the model or the data used to train the model

i.e. assuming *Decision Tree Algorithm* and feature extraction are correctly implemented (according to specification), is the model learned from data any good?

The model is just one component of the entire system.

Focus on measuring quality, not debugging the source of quality problems (e.g., in data, in feature extraction, in learning, in infrastructure)


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Some System-Level Considerations

* Models used by radiologists, humans in the loop
* Radiologists are specialists who do not directly see patients
* Radiologists may not trust model, but are also overworked
* Radiologist must explain findings
* Patient can see findings before physician (CURES act)
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Many Model Qualities

Prediction accuracy of a model is important

But many other *model qualities* matters when building a system:
* Model size
* Inference latency
* Learning latency
* User interaction model
* Ability to incrementally learn
* Explainability
* Calibration
* Robustness
</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Today and Next Lecture

*Narrow focus on prediction accuracy of the model*

That's difficult enough for now.

</script></section></section><section  data-markdown><script type="text/template"># On Terminology

**Model:** $\overline{X} \rightarrow Y$

**Validation/test data:** sets of $(\overline{X}, Y)$ pairs indicating desired outcomes for select inputs

**Performance:** In machine learning, "performance" typically refers to accuracy

"this model performs better" = it produces more accurate results

Be aware of ambiguity across communities (see also: performance in arts, job performance, company performance, performance test (bar exam) in law, software/hardware/network performance)

* When speaking of "**time**", be explicit: "learning time", "inference latency", ...
* When speaking of model **accuracy** use "prediction accuracy", ...

Measuring success of correct classifications (or missing results):
* Recall = TP/(TP+FN) 
    * aka true positive rate, hit rate, sensitivity; *higher is better*
* False negative rate = FN/(TP+FN) = 1 - recall 
    * aka miss rate; *lower is better*

*** 

Measuring rate of false classifications (or noise):
* Precision = TP/(TP+FP)
    * aka positive predictive value; *higher is better*
* False positive rate = FP/(FP+TN) 
    * aka fall-out; *lower is better*
<!-- * False discovery rate = FP/(FP+TP) = 1 - precision -->

Combined measure (harmonic mean):

F1 score = $2 \frac{recall*precision}{recall+precision}$

Always test for generalization on *unseen* validation data (independently sampled from the same distriution)

Accuracy on training data (or similar measure) used during learning

```scala
train_xs, train_ys, valid_xs, valid_ys = split(all_xs, all_ys)
model = learn(train_xs, train_ys)

accuracy_train = accuracy(model, train_xs, train_ys)

## Overfitting/Underfitting

**Overfitting:** Model learned exactly for the input data, but does not generalize to unseen data (e.g., exact memorization)

**Underfitting:** Model makes very general observations but poorly fits to data (e.g., brightness in picture)

Typically adjust degrees of freedom during model learning to balance between overfitting and underfitting: can better learn the training data with more freedom (more complex models); but with too much freedom, will memorize details of the training data rather than generalizing

* Motivation
  * Evaluate accuracy on different training and validation splits
  * Evaluate with small amounts of validation data
* Method: Repeated partitioning of data into train and validation data, train and evaluate model on each partition, average results
* Many split strategies, including 
  * leave-one-out: evaluate on each datapoint using all other data for training
  * k-fold: $k$ equal-sized partitions, evaluate on each training on others
  * repeated random sub-sampling (Monte Carlo)

</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## Separate Training, Validation and Test Data

Often a model is "tuned" manually or automatically on a validation set (hyperparameter optimization)

In this case, we can overfit on the validation set, separate test set is needed for final evaluation


```scala
train_xs, train_ys, valid_xs, valid_ys, test_xs, test_ys = 
            split(all_xs, all_ys)

best_model = null
best_model_accuracy = 0
for (hyperparameters in candidate_hyperparameters) 
  candidate_model = learn(train_xs, train_ys, hyperparameter)
  model_accuracy = accuracy(model, valid_xs, valid_ys)  
  if (model_accuracy > best_model_accuracy) 
    best_model = candidate_model
    best_model_accuracy = model_accuracy

accuracy_test = accuracy(model, test_xs, test_ys)
```




</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## On Terminology

* The decisions in a model (weights, coefficients) are called *model parameter* of the model, their values are usually learned from the data
  - To a software engineer, these are *constants* in the learned function
* The inputs to the learning algorithm that are not the data are called *model hyperparameters*
  - To a software engineer, these are *parameters* to the learning algorithm, similar to compiler options

```
// max_depth and min_support are hyperparameters

strategy: The network has learned to associate object location with a category. During training,
stars were always shown in the top right or bottom left of an image; moons in the top left or bottom

* Test data curation is emerging as a very recent concept for testing ML components

* Credit rating should not depend on gender:

* Synonyms should not change the sentiment of text:
    - $\forall x. f(x) = f(\texttt{replace}(x, \text{"is not", "isn't"}))$

Formal description of relationships among inputs and outputs (*Metamorphic Relations*)

In general, for a model $f$ and inputs $x$ define two functions to transform inputs and outputs $g\_I$ and $g\_O$ such that:

$\forall x. f(g\_I(x)) = g\_O(f(x))$

<!-- vspace -->

e.g. $g\_I(x)= \texttt{replace}(x, \text{" is ", " is not "})$ and $g\_O(x)=\neg x$


</script></section><section data-markdown><script type="text/template">## On Testing with Invariants/Assertions

* Defining good metamorphic relations requires knowledge of the problem domain
* Good metamorphic relations focus on parts of the system
* Invariants usually cover only one aspect of correctness -- maybe capabilities
* Invariants and near-invariants can be mined automatically from sample data (see *specification mining* and *anchors*)

* Derive input-output pairs from simulation, esp. in vision systems
